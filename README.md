## 🤔 What's This All About?

Ever driven into a pothole so deep you thought you'd reach the Earth's core? 🌋 Or maybe you've swerved to avoid road damage and nearly turned your car into a stunt vehicle? Well, fear no more, brave commuter!

**Road Defect Reporter** is your highway hero 🦸‍♂️ - a mobile app that lets you report road defects faster than you can say "my suspension is ruined!"

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!"

- 📸 **Snap & Report**: Take photos of road defects and show the world your photography skills (and that dangerous crack in the asphalt)
- 🗺️ **Location Magic**: Automatically captures where the defect is hiding, so you don't have to remember cryptic street names
- 🚦 **Priority System**: Mark defects as "Meh," "Yikes," or "OH MY GOODNESS FIX THIS NOW!" (we call these Low, Medium, and High priority)
- 👀 **Track Progress**: Watch as your reports move from "We've seen it" to "We're fixing it" to "All better now!"
- 👑 **Admin Powers**: Special features for those special people who get to decide which holes get filled first (lucky them!)

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started (It's Easy, Promise!)
